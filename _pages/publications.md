This page contains a list of my publications, starting with my first author manuscripts. For more details, please
visit my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HHacAS0AAAAJ&hl=en). I've tried to link 
PDFs of the final articles where the publishing license allows. Otherwise, please feel free to contact me if your 
institution doesn't provide access to one of the articles below.
