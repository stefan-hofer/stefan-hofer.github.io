I'm interested in how ice sheets and polar climates are influenced by human activities. My personal research so far has focused mainly on the role of clouds in recent and future Greenland Ice Sheet melt. However, I've also been involved in the NERC Black&Bloom project focusing on the role of ice algae in the darkening of glacial ice over Greenland, and the influence of changes in atmospheric circulation on the Arctic warming.
